# Introduction  
This is a Discord bot created by student.  
Hope you enjoy it!

# Invitation Links
bot1 : https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1092497000945160324&permissions=0&scope=bot   
After opening the link above with your discord account, you can invite it into your servers.  
The creater (yeah it's me) won't be authorized as an administrator.  
> bot2 : https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1121384376991752234&permissions=8&scope=bot  
> Sometimes I use the other bot so I suggest you to invite both of them into your servers.
